### Buh-bye Jekyll

I tried to get Jekyll working again after 3 years on inactivity. It was painful enough that I said eff it.  My tolerance for Ruby related pain is extremely low these days.

### Hello Hexo

Since we use a lot of Node.js at Kash, I decided to switch to Hexo. It seems to be a polished Jekyll clone. Really the most important thing for me to keep my actual content in markdown. I expect to move again, and markdown does the job.
