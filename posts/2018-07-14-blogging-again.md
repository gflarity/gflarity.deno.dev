#### Blogging again!?
This just a quick note where I pretend someone else is actually reading this. I'm back to blogging again. Sort of... I'm going to try my hand at making in depth technology related explorations. In the process of making these videos I'm going to inevitably create talking notes. I'm planning to polish these notes into blog posts that accompany the video.  At least this is the current plan.

#### Why?

1. Online videos/youtube is are a huge leap in terms of educational advancement. I'd like to be a small art of that. 
2. I agonize over the written form in a way I just don't with video. At least presently. I'm hoping to not let perfect be the enemy of the good. 
3. There's a lot of different topics I'd like to explore and share.
