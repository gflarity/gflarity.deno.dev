title: I Switched To Deno
---

Just a quick "hello world" post for switching to deno.land/x/blog for blogging. I've been using Deno for a bunch of my personal projects and I'm really enjoying it. I'll put my thoughts on why into a post soon. But first I needed to update my "blogging" software to use Deno. This module was exactly what I was looking for. Very easy, I can just use markdown files for posts.
