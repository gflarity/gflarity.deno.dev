During the process of preparing for a another vidcast/vlog, it occurred to me that I was taking installing Minikube a bit for granted. It's super easy of course, but that isn't immediately obvious nor is how valuable Minikube is. So I did a quick vidcast in order to both practice and make sure this info was out there. Enjoy:

## Installing VirtualBox

[Virtualbox Download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads). I went with the Ubuntu 18.04 .deb file which I just clicked on. 

## Installing Kubectl

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

### Linux 
```bash

```
