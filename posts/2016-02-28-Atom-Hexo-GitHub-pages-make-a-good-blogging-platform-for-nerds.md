There are lots of blogging platforms out there. But I want to use markdown with git. So this is how I do it.

See my older post on [Atom here](https://gflarity.github.io/2016/02/27/Atom-editor-is-worth-watching/).

Go install [Hexo](http://hexo.io).

Install the [atom-hexo](https://atom.io/packages/atom-hexo) for Atom.

Install the [git-plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus) form Atom.

Setup your [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com) repo.

Configure Hexo to [deploy with git](https://jdpaton.github.io/2012/11/05/setup-hexo/).

You can create new post, commit it, and deploy by using package commands now.
